# VR / WEBXR Example

Nice little example of messing around with WEB-XR and interfacing with VR Headsets. Tested on a Varjo Aero with 4 base stations and Valve Index Knuckle controllers. (https://immersiveweb.dev/) and sinking my teeth into babylonjs (https://www.babylonjs.com/) for some technical experimentation and exploration.

Built with React, vite, few other things and deployed on vercel. Check it out here: https://vr-webxr.vercel.app/
